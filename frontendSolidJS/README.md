# Milsim Frontend - SolidJS Migration

This directory contains the SolidJS migration of the Milsim frontend.

## Migration Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Basic project structure and configuration
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Authentication and game services
- Toast context system
- Login component
- Global CSS styles
- Vite configuration for SolidJS

ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
- Migration of remaining components from React to SolidJS
- Migration of hooks and utilities

## Key Changes from React to SolidJS

### State Management
- `useState` â†’ `createSignal`
- `useEffect` â†’ `createEffect`
- `useCallback` â†’ Direct function definitions (SolidJS doesn't need memoization like React)

### Context System
- `React.createContext` â†’ `createContext` from SolidJS
- `useContext` â†’ `useContext` from SolidJS
- Context providers follow similar patterns

### Component Structure
- Functional components remain similar
- JSX syntax remains mostly the same
- Event handlers use SolidJS patterns (`onInput` instead of `onChange`)

### Routing
- `react-router-dom` â†’ `@solidjs/router`
- Similar API with minor syntax differences

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
cd frontendSolidJS
npm install
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # SolidJS dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts          # Vite configuration for SolidJS
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ index.html              # HTML entry point
```

## Migration Notes

1. **Services and Types**: These were migrated with minimal changes since they're framework-agnostic
2. **Components**: Each component needs to be converted from React patterns to SolidJS patterns
3. **Hooks**: React hooks need to be converted to SolidJS primitives or custom stores
4. **Performance**: SolidJS offers better performance with fine-grained reactivity

## Next Steps

1. Migrate remaining components (Dashboard, GameOwner, GamePlayer, etc.)
2. Convert React hooks to SolidJS stores and primitives
3. Test the complete application
4. Update build scripts to use SolidJS frontend by default
