// Control points functionality for players - Refactored version
// This file now loads all functionality from separate modules

// Since we're using vanilla JavaScript without ES6 modules,
// we'll include all the separate files via script tags in the HTML
// This file serves as documentation and placeholder

// The functionality has been split into the following files:
// - control-points-player/bomb-timer.js (bomb timer functionality)
// - control-points-player/position-challenge.js (position challenge functionality)
// - control-points-player/markers-popups.js (markers and popups functionality)
// - control-points-player/challenge-submissions.js (challenge submission functions)

// To use the refactored version, update the HTML to include:
// <script src="js/control-points-player/bomb-timer.js"></script>
// <script src="js/control-points-player/position-challenge.js"></script>
// <script src="js/control-points-player/markers-popups.js"></script>
// <script src="js/control-points-player/challenge-submissions.js"></script>

// All functions are exported to the window object for backward compatibility
// No changes needed in existing code that calls these functions
